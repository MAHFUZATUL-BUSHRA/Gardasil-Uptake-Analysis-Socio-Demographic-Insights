# Gardasil Vaccine Completion Analysis at JHMI Clinics (2006â€“2008)
|| Identifying the Association between Gardasil Vaccine Completion Rate and various Socio-demographics Predictors using the Data gathered at Four Clinics of Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (JHMI) during 2006-2008 ||
### Description:
This project explores the socio-demographic factors influencing Gardasil vaccine completion rates using data from four Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (JHMI) clinics. Conducted as a retrospective study, it analyzes disparities in vaccine completion based on race, age, insurance type, and clinic location. The project also examines whether the shift to a two-dose regimen would impact completion rates. Key methodologies include exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and logistic regression modeling.

### Key Features:

* Analysis of 1,413 patient records from urban and suburban clinics.
* Identification of factors like race, age group, and insurance affecting vaccine completion.
* Statistical tests including Chi-square, Z-tests, and Odds Ratios.
* Logistic regression to assess predictors of vaccine completion.

### Tools Used:

* R for data preparation and analysis.
* Microsoft Excel for custom visualizations.

Highlights:

* Insights into racial disparities and urban-suburban differences in vaccine uptake.
* Discussion of the implications of switching to a two-dose regimen.
* Recommendations for improving vaccine completion rates.
